# Custom Prompts for AI Coding Agents

This project provides a set of prompts for AI coding agents to implement a structured, two-step Plan & Execute workflow, inspired by the principles of [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/).

The primary motivation behind this methodology is to minimize the time and prompt iterations required to generate working code, improve overall code quality, and enable seamless switching between AI coding agents within the same project.

Inspired by [Kiro-style Prompts for Spec-Driven Development](https://github.com/andreskull/spec-driven-ai-coding), this implementation significantly simplifies documentation-driven workflow. Feature specifications are captured in a dedicated `prd.md` file, creating a shared source of truth that persists beyond individual chat sessions. This enables team collaboration and work resumption while utilizing Planner and Executor operational modes.

## The Core Workflow: Plan & Execute

The methodology is split into two distinct phases, each handled by a dedicated custom AI agent mode.

1. **Planning phase (Planner mode):** The AI acts as a senior architect. You provide a high-level feature description, and the AI guides you through an interactive process to create a complete technical specification.
1. **Execution phase (Executor mode):** The AI acts as a meticulous engineer. It reads the approved specification and implements the feature, ensuring strict adherence to the plan.

## Setting Up the Workflow

This workflow uses two distinct AI personas, each with a specific role. The setup process varies between different AI coding tools.

### Cursor (custom modes)

**1. Planner Mode (The Architect):**

- **Mode Name:** "Planner"
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.1 (powerful models for complex planning)
- **Prompt:** Copy the entire content from `prompts/planner.md`
- **Context:** ‚úÖ Enable "Full folder context"
- **Tools:** ‚úÖ Enable "Search codebase", "Read file", "Edit & Reapply", "Run terminal" (to generate a feature PRD file)
- **Tools:** ‚ùå Disable all tools (Planner should not make code changes)
- **Automation:** ‚ùå Disable auto-apply, auto-run, auto-fix (manual review required)

**2. Executor Mode (The Engineer)**

- **Mode Name:** "Executor"
- **Model:** Claude 4 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Flash or Pro (fast, capable models)
- **Prompt:** Copy the entire content from `prompts/executor.md`
- **Context:** ‚úÖ Enable "Full folder context"
- **Tools:** ‚úÖ Enable all tools (file editing, terminal, etc.)
- **Automation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional - Enable auto-apply edits, auto-run, and auto-fix errors for autonomous execution. Prefer manual review.

### Kilo Code (modes)

**1. Planner Mode (The Architect):**

- **API Configuration:** Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.1 (powerful models for complex planning)
- **Name:** "Planner üí¨"
- **Save Location:** "Global" (available in all workspaces)
- **Role Definition:** Copy <persona> inner content from `prompts/planner.md`
- **Short description (for humans):** "Plan and design step-by-step technical specification"
- **When to Use (optional):** "Use this mode when you need to plan, design, or strategize before implementation. Perfect for breaking down complex problems, creating technical specifications, designing system architecture, or brainstorming solutions before coding."
- **Available Tools:** ‚úÖ Enable "Read Files", "Edit Files (Markdown files only)", "Use Browser"
  - Use this mode's `group` configuration

    ```
    groups:
      - read
      - - edit
        - fileRegex: \.md$
          description: Markdown files only
      - browser
    ```

- **Custom Instructions (optional):** Copy the entire content (except <persona> tag) from `prompts/planner.md`

**2. Executor Mode (The Engineer)**

- **API Configuration:** Claude 4 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Flash or Pro (fast, capable models)
- **Name:** "Executor üî®"
- **Save Location:** "Global" (available in all workspaces)
- **Role Definition:** Copy <persona> inner content from `prompts/executor.md`
- **Short description (for humans):** "Implement features based on pre-approved specification"
- **When to Use (optional):** "Use this mode when you need to implement a feature whose spec you approved during the Planning mode. Ideal for implementing features, fixing bugs, creating new files, or making code improvements across any programming language or framework."
- **Available Tools:** ‚úÖ Enable "Read Files", "Edit Files", "Use Browser", "Run Commands", "Use MCP"
- **Custom Instructions (optional):** Copy the entire content (except <persona> tag) from `prompts/executor.md`

## Workflow Usage

### Planner persona usage

1. Switch to _Planner_ persona in your chosen AI tool.
2. Provide an in-depth feature description.
3. The _Planner_ will guide you through an interactive process to define the blueprint for your feature (_what_ you're building, for _whom_, and _why_) ‚Äî `prd.md` in a new `docs/specs/{feature-name}/` directory.
4. Review and approve to complete the plan.

### Executor persona usage

1. Switch to _Executor_ persona in your chosen AI tool.
2. The _Executor_ will read relevant documentation to understand the system context before executing a feature.
3. The _Executor_ will automatically pick up the plan created by the _Planner_ mode and implement it.
